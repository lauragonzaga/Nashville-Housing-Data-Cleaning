This data cleaning project was created following the tutorial on Alex the Analyst's channel. 
However, most of these queries I wrote on my own while pausing the video. I mostly used the tutorial for the database and for orientations on what to do.

Here is the link to the dataset: https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx

This was made in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 20.
